# 🚢 Titanic Data Handling & Visualization Project

This project is part of **Month 2: Data Handling & Visualization** in my coding roadmap.  
It uses the famous [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) to practice **data cleaning** and **visualization** with Python.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
📦 titanic_project
 ┣ 📜 titanic_cleaner.py      # Cleans and preprocesses raw Titanic dataset
 ┣ 📜 titanic_visualizer.py   # Creates survival and demographic visualizations
 ┣ 📜 titanic_cleaned.csv     # Cleaned dataset generated by cleaner script
 ┣ 🖼️ survival_count.png      # Plot: Survivors vs Non-Survivors
 ┣ 🖼️ survival_by_gender.png  # Plot: Male vs Female survival
 ┣ 🖼️ survival_by_class.png   # Plot: Survival by passenger class
 ┣ 🖼️ age_distribution.png    # Plot: Distribution of passenger ages
 ┗ 📜 README.md               # Project documentation
```

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** → data cleaning & handling  
- **Matplotlib** → data visualization  
- **Seaborn** → better styled plots  

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`) from Kaggle and place it in your project folder.  
2. Run the cleaning script to prepare the dataset:

```bash
python titanic_cleaner.py
```

This creates **titanic_cleaned.csv**.

3. Run the visualization script:

```bash
python titanic_visualizer.py
```

This generates plots (`.png` images).

## 📊 Visual Outputs

### Survival Count
Shows how many passengers survived vs. did not survive.

### Survival by Gender
Breakdown of survival by **male vs female**.

### Survival by Class
Survival comparison across **Pclass (1st, 2nd, 3rd class)**.

### Age Distribution
Distribution of passengers' ages.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

- Practiced **data cleaning** with Pandas (handling missing values, dropping irrelevant features).  
- Built **visual insights** using Matplotlib & Seaborn.  
- Improved understanding of dataset preprocessing workflow.
